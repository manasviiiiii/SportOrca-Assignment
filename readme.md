## 🚀 Project Overview

This web application displays a dynamic list of **upcoming Premier League soccer matches**, fetched from a free and public sports API. It is built using pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with modular separation into three files:

- `index.html`: Structure and layout
- `style.css`: Styling and responsiveness
- `script.js`: Logic for fetching, filtering, and displaying match data

🔗 **Live API Used:**  
[`https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/3/eventsnextleague.php?id=4328`](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/3/eventsnextleague.php?id=4328)
